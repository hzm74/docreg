<p>
  Django is my project to manage documents.
  For example an architect as a document/drawing which has to be approved by a builder-company, constructor and other firms.
  The architect sends multiple documents and wants to keep track if the documents are approved by the given time.
  
  I wanna do this with the help of a postgres database and the help of django.

  Install instructions:
  - setup a python virtual environment.
  - install django.
  - clone this repository and run the django-project.
